work order:

small groups will regroup and join together
Groups that arent moving will retask
Auto save
24/7 uptime

To be completed:
Build mission generation system - using helpers, we dynamically grab them and create objects/units in those positions allowing for dynamic mission build design.
continue work on economy
ai Response to objectives being attacked/not captured, [current mission, objective/pos]


in testing:
Body cleanup - Simple, but will need to be checked
persistent markers - will see how MP Plays
update debug to reflect the owner and ticks - Related to the marker weight debug
setup marker weight debug - Basic System put together
AI population in buildings - looks to be working
opfor Force pool balance - TBD.
getting objectives captured and checking the decay and previous owner for update on tick, probably change the loading to keep the full data in one array - looks functional?
obj decay, double check function, maybe be able to display obj info if player standing in it? - looks okay
Figure out enemy persistance - looking good so far


Finished:
be able to reset all variables - Looks good
Figure out AI not spawning in captured sectors - seems good
Slow down timer for core loop - EZ
enemies recon and assault blufor sectors - Kinda? They have tasking framework
start working on the different tasking functions for their actions, attack, recon ect. - Sorta, they have tasking framework
ENEMY TASKING FOR GODS SAKE FIGURE IT OUT - Figure out a way to complete tasking https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/inArea - again, tasking framework
Get loop system figured out and working - functioning
complete/convert opfor_convert - needs testing - I still dunno wtf opfor convert was
make sure markers load on start, set them up with last captured by in 2nd index - markers setup to load, needs full loop implementation - Yeah fine
